# Course Notes

## JSX 
* JSX elements are made using calls to React.createElement()
* Void tags (e.g. `<Component/>`) 
* Valid JSX may sometimes be invalid html

## Components
* when using an html `class` attribute, we use `className` (e.g. `<div className="">`)

Every time react senses a change, it re-renders

## Hooks
* 
* `useState` depends heavily on the order that it's called. So don't have conditional hooks or inside of loops.
